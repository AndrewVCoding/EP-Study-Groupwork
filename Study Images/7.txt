A stone giant sits in his stone chair, lit from above and below in his memorial. Abraham Lincoln carved into life, one leg extended to rest on the edge of his pedestal, his arms resting on the cold chair, while he softly stares down at you. Yellow lights above gently warm the text carved into the wall behind him, while white lights illuminate his historic visage.
