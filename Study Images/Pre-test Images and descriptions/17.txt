A man clings to a gray, sloping cliff face. He pushes upwards, digging his feet into the speckled stone beneath him. Green grass and sparse pine trees grow on the rocky mountains behind him. Only a small patch of bright sky is visible above the climber, where the cliff ascends past the distant mountain  slope.
