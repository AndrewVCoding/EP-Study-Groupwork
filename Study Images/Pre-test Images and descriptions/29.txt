A woman gazes passively off camera. Her face framed by a round chin and long brown hair. A large pair of glasses encircles her distant eyes, thin frames resting lightly on her nose. She wears a short sleeve shirt, buttoned up to her neck, black with a white grid. Painted plants grow up the walls of a building behind her, flat imitations of what lies beneath them.
