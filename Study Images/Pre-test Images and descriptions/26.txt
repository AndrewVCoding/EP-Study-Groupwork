Vibrant green grass overtakes rings of rough round rocks, encircling a pile of jagged stones. The land beyond gently cups the low hanging orb of orange light in the sky, guarding the entrance to this field with a tower of stony cliffs on the right. More grass grows on the ledges, carpeting the natural steps leading upward toward a swirling body of clouds and the still blue sky.
