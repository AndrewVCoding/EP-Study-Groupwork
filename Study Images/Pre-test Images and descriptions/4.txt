Curiosity tugs the cat's head to the side. Their grey ears point to the left side of the image as they gaze at the camera from the depths of an open box. The dark grey fur on the cat's back fades into the unlit bottom of the box, while their white underbelly and face pridefully stand out. Its large pupils, ringed in soft, green irises, focus on the camera. Long white whiskers extend from a small nose with a warm brown smudge above the cat's mouth.
