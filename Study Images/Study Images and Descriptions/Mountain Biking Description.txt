Dressed in bright yellow, the mountain biker hangs in the air. He looks down towards a natural brown ramp, a likely spot to land. The steps of dirt and dry grass behind and below him, more dirt and dry grass extending out to the horizon to meet a blanket of clouds. He confidently holds his bike below him, positioned as a buffer between himself and the cruel dirt he races toward, ready to absorb the impact in his bent legs.
