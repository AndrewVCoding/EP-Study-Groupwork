The smooth glass surface of the water is hardly disturbed by ripples from a pair of orca whales gently breaching the barrier into the air. Rolling hills covered in a carpet of trees climb their way to the top of the image, barring an overcast sky from sight except for glimpses of the gray clouds in the reflection on the water. A misty jet of water hangs above the two whales. One of them is falling back under the water, the other still holds its head up, just behind the dorsal fin of the first.
