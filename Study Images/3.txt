A baseball player winds up to throw the ball, lunging forward as his arm flys back. His left foot points into the dirt, his right leg carrying his weight, ready to pull him forwards into the throw. The number 20 stands boldly out on his back, contrasting his white uniform while complementing the long blue sleeves of his undershirt. His tight focus on the throw leaves the audience in the stands as nothing more than a dull blur in the background. His right arm extends forward, drawing his attention to his target.
