A small village rests nestled in a valley, surrounded by the dense green of gentle, tree covered mountains. In the distance, perched on a hill, is a church. It's beige walls supporting a steep roof and pointed bell tower. Several large buildings step down the slope, their white walls and red roofs disappearing behind a bright tree line. Two houses sit close by, on the opposite shore of a small pond from the camera. The one on the right features dark solar panels on its steep roof and a small red tree in front of it.
