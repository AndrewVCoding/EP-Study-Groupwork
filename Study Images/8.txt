A man seems to float, belly down, above a city skyline. The people on the pier behind him watching as he dives toward the water below. He wears only a pair of black shorts and raises his outspread arms above his back like the wings of a bird. The skyscrapers behind him shine a light blue in the overcast light, contrasting a bright red suspension bridge over the water.
