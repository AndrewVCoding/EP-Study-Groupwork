The fiery sun hangs low above the horizon, casting a bright, white glow across the  pale, orange sky. A skater holds a handstand on the edge of a bowl, using his other hand to hold the board to his feet. While his arm touches the edge, the rest of his body hangs out over empty space, ready to fall back down rotating and extending his legs, with the board, back onto the concrete surface. Hints of the golden sun reflect off the concrete and the skater.
